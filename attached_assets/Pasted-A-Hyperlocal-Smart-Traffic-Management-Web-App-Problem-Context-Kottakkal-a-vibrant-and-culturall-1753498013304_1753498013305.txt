A Hyperlocal Smart Traffic Management Web App

🧩 Problem Context
Kottakkal, a vibrant and culturally active town in Kerala, faces frequent traffic congestion, particularly near:

Changuvetty, AVS Junction, Almas Hospital

Crowded temple roads during festivals (like Pooram)

Local commercial hotspots (market zones, food stalls, thattukada zones)

Roads often used by rickshaws, school vans, and emergency vehicles

The lack of live traffic intelligence, poor route adaptability, and unreported blocks/potholes cause delays, emergency risks, and public frustration.

🎯 Objective
To build a web-based traffic solution that empowers:

Citizens to navigate easily

Rickshaws & local transporters to move smarter

Municipality staff to act fast

Emergency services to respond without delay

Through smart data, map-based logic, and Kottakkal-specific features.

👥 Users
Daily commuters & college students

Auto rickshaw and taxi drivers

Emergency services (Ambulance, Fire, Police)

Local authorities (Municipality, MVD)

Delivery, KSRTC & school bus operators
